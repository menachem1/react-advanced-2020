    desc: `When King Solomon built the first Holy Temple in 826 BCE, he wanted it to be the heart of the Jewish nation—a place where people felt inspired to talk to G‑d, a place where no one would feel alone. "Please, G‑d," he said during the Temple's inauguration, "Hear the prayers that are said in this place."

    Solomon's prayers were answered, and G‑d's presence enlivened the Temple. The Second Temple, built 480 years later, also was a home to G‑d's presence.

    The midrash says that "the Shechinah never left the Western Wall." Specifically the Western Wall, because the Holy of Holies was on the west side of the Temple. "This is the Western Wall of the Temple, which is never destroyed because the Shechina is in the west."

    The holiness of the Western Wall is due to its close proximity to the Temple area. Click here for more about the Holy Temple, and the reasons why it is the Gateway to Heaven. Click here for more readings on the Western Wall.
